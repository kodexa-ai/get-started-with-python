    "Kodexa documents are centered around the content model, and they're designed to allow developers to work with a wide range of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured content. The document has a root content node which has zero-to-many child content nodes. These content nodes are arranged in a hierarchical structure and represent the content of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "A content node has several core properties such as type, content, content_parts, children, and feature(s).\n",
    "* **type:** The specific type of this content node.\n",
    "* **parent:** Each node is aware of its parent. Only a root content node on a document would not have a parent.\n",
    "* **features:** Features are a way to store/add additional information about a content node.  The features property on a content node is a collection of features.\n",
    "* **content:** The text representation of the content.\n",
    "* **content_parts:** An array version of the content, this is used to break the content and intersperse it with the children, allowing us to understand where the child nodes fit into the content, it is not always present, and is only present if the structure allows for child nodes to be embedded into the content at specific locations.\n",
    "* **children:** The child content nodes that roll up to this content node.\n",
    "\n",
    "While at a generic level everything can be thought of as a content node, we leverage the 'type' property on the content node to provide meaning to the hierarchy. In our example, we're using an HTML file, and we should expect to see content nodes with types such as 'div', 'p', 'span', etc.  If we were parsing a PDF file, we may see type values such as 'page' or 'line'.\n",
    "\n",
    "When source content has been parsed and structured in a Kodexa document, it's broken up into a tree of nodes.  Each of these nodes can capture a portion of the original content (text), and may also have one or more \"features\". Features allow flexibility in the way that we capture metadata about content, and allow us to add new information to a node that we may want to use in later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll be focusing on the **type**, **features**, and **content** of our content nodes.\n",

Tagging is a way to provide meaning to a piece of content; for example, you may choose to tag data that repeats at the top of each page as a page header, or you may be working with a spreadsheet and choose to use Kodexa's Excel Table Tagger to tag your data as a table.  A tag is a special type of feature, and is stored just like any other feature.  In our case, we're going to tag the nodes that we'll want to include in our summarization action.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In Kodexa, adding a tag to a node is done using the pattern-based Node Tagger.  This action accepts the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **selector:**  This is a selector value that matches the properties of the node node you’d like to tag.  For example, if you had parsed an HTML document, you may want to tag all paragraphs, divs, and list items - that selector value would be \"//p | //div | //li\".\n",
    "* **tag_to_apply:**  This is the tag name you’d like added to all matching nodes.  So, if you want to add the tag “weather”, just pass in the string “weather”.\n",
    "* **content_re:**  This regular expression value (regex) is used to identify a sub-portion of content in the node(s) identified by the selector.  For example, if you've selected a 'p' node that has the content \"The sun is shining brighly today\", and you'd like to tag only the words \"sun\" and \"shining\", you would provide a content_re value of \"(sun|shining)\".  A tag would be added to each match in the matching group.\n",
    "* **use_all_content:**  Boolean parameter indicating if the content_re regex value should be applied only to this node or if it should be applied to this node’s child nodes, as well.  If this parameter is False (the default), only the content value of this node will be used for the content_re match.  If this parameter is True, then this node’s content value and this node’s child nodes content values will be matched to the content_re regex. \n",
    "* **node_only:**  Boolean parameter (default False) indicating if the tag_name should be applied at the node level, or if it should be applied more granularly to the matching groups (matching the content_re regex) at their matching indexes.  This parameter is important if you've provided a value for the content_re parameter and there's a match within the node.  If you've set this value to True, then the node will be tagged with the value of the tag_name.  If you've left this False, then the node will be tagged with the tag_name value, but the specific location of the match within the node's content will also be captured.  This allows you to later go back and identify/extract that exact string of text that matched the content_re regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can determine the parameter values necessary for tagging our data:\n",
    "* selector:  We know that the content nodes we want to use for our summary are all of type 'p' and should have a value (must filter out anything empty or None), so we'll provide values for our selector that will limit results to nodes that meet that criteria.\n",

       "'Good news retirement savers: The Internal Revenue Service announced cost of living increases to the contribution limits for retirement-related plans in 2019. Annual contribution limits to 401(k)s will increase to $19,000 from $18,500. And the annual contribution to an IRA, last increased in 2013, rises to $6,000 from $5,500. \"This is another win for investors and savers,\" says Stephanie Bacak, a financial planner at Capstone Global Advisors. \"For so long there were really no cost of living increases in the IRA so it is a great opportunity for so many to be more prepared for retirement.\" Catch-up contributions, available to those age 50 and over, will remain unchanged at $6,000 for 401(k)s and $1,000 for IRAs.  In addition to 401(k)s, limits for 403(b)s, most 457 plans and the federal government\\'s Thrift Savings Plan will also increase to $19,000. Also rising next year are the income ranges that determine eligibility for deductible contributions to IRAs, to Roth IRAs, and to claim the saver\\'s credit. For example, the income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA increased to $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000. The IRS increases are helpful, says Shane Mason, certified financial planner at Brooklyn FI, but only if you are able to make the maximum contribution. He says those who want to continue to max out their 401(k) should revisit their contributions to make sure they\\'re putting in enough with each paycheck. Those that are paid semi-monthly (twice a month or 24 times a year) should be contributing $792 per paycheck and those paid biweekly (every two weeks or 26 times a year) should be contributing $731 per paycheck.
