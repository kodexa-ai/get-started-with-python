    "# Adding Features and Tagging Kodexa Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be exploring two key elements of a document's content nodes, features and tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Features give us a way to store additional information about a content node, such as spatial coordinates or other node-enriching data.  Tags are a special type of feature who's \"feature_type\" property is always \"tag\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about featuers & tags in our [Developer Documentation](https://developer.kodexa.com/kodexa-platform/key-concepts/selectors-tags-and-features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding tags and features to documents is widely used in Kodexa.  Tagging allows users to identify content and \"label\" it for later uses, such as data extraction or logical decision making.  Tags also allow users to add data to a doucment without altering the document's underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you examples of adding features and tags to documents, and using those tags to perform additional processing steps.\n"
