    "# Providing Data to Pipelines with Connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectors are used to provide data to Pipelines.  Just as there are many types of unstructure data, there are multiple ways to connect that data to pipelines (we're just so flexible).  You can read files, folders, URLs, or just pass in plain text.  We've provided examples of those connectors you're most likely to find useful in your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plain text\n",
    "* Existing Kodexa document\n",
    "* From a Kodexa JsonDocumentStore\n",
    "* From a folder, using the FolderConnector\n",
    "* From a file, using the FileHandleConnector\n",
    "* From a URL, using the URLConnector\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a Kodexa Document from plain text or reading a JsonDocumentStore of fully formed Kodexa Documents, you do not need to add a step to the pipeline to parse the documents.  The pipeline will be able to process these documents into fully-formed Kodexa Documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using connectors of other types (files, folders, URLs) to read non-Kodexa Documents, you will need to add a pipeline step to parse the document so that it's fully-formed.  If you do not provide a parser, Kodexa Documents will still be returned by the pipeline, but there will be no content node text on the document, only metadata describing the connector and document source details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup our imports\n",
    "1. We'll be building pipelines to process our document, so we'll import Kodexa's Pipeline module\n",
    "2. Import all the connector types that we plan to try out\n",
    "3. Some of our parsing will need to happen in the could, so we'll import the KodexaPlatform and KodexaAction modules\n",
    "4. All files that have been processed/parsed in Kodexa become Kodexa Documents, so we'll import that module as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also setting the CLOUD_URL value to the platform environment on which we want to perform our processing.\n"
